## How to use

This repository is meant to be used as a reference. I recommend you [**follow the official guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/), that in details explains the process of creating a bootable USB to installing macOS and finally fixing issues that have occurred during install or post-install phase.

In case you don't have enough time to read the docs, proceed as follows:

  1. [**Create bootable USB**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/).  
  2. Clone this repository, copy and paste "EFI" directory onto your USB drive.
  3. [**Generate SMBIOS for MacBookPro11,2**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#generate-a-new-serial) and [**fix ROM**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/iservices.html#fixing-rom).  
  4. Set BIOS settings according to the [**guide**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/haswell.html#intel-bios-settings).  
  5. [**Install macOS**](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installation/installation-process.html#booting-the-opencore-usb).
